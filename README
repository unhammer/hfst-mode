Major mode for twolc and lexc files.

HFST is Helsinki Finite State Tools, which uses OpenFST/foma/SFST/… to
create an free and open source alternative to Xerox Finite State
Tools.

hfst-mode provides syntax highlighting for the twolc and lexc formats.
There is so far just one keyboard shortcut, `C-c G`, or
`hfst-goto-lexicon`, which moves you to the definition of the
continuation lexicon referenced by the current entry.

Usage:

    (autoload 'hfst-mode "~/path/to/hfst-mode/hfst.el")
    ; Change these lines if you name your files something other
    ; than .twol and .lexc:
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.twol\\'" . hfst-mode))
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.xfst\\'" . hfst-mode))
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.lexc\\'" . hfst-mode))
